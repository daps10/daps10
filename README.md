My life thumbnail sketch :

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to manage my time, and be productive.

I strongly believe that constant learning is a part of our journey, and if at some point one stops the process, that person is out of the game. My constant learning in both horizontal and vertical dimensions has landed me some of the best opportunities I could have ever dreamt of, in the last few years. Coming from a strong tech background, spending most of my time learning and teaching code, I found another vertical of mine which was to do coding and become an coder. Currently, I'm working in hyperlink infosystem company.

Spending almost two years into php and node js, and taught almost 2 years for get an good amount of knowlegde in app developement and rest api's.
